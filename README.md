# Decentralized Library - DeLib Inc

DeLib Inc is a startup company that wants to harness the power of web3 to implement a Decentralized Library. It aims at allowing its users to share files and storage their data.

## Problem Statement

They would like to:
1. Create a "Web3 Platform", which would be used by customers or users to do the following:
    -   Upload Files
    -   Retrieve Files
    -   Share files
    -   Delete Files (optional). 
2. Design and Implement a MVP Prototype to showcase the customers requirements.

## Task
Build a  prototype that has all of the above features and using the ERC 721 standard to connect to the frontend.

## Solution

The team had a meeting to ideate on the problem and after a successful meeting, we came up with some solutions but had to drill down to one because of several factor such as time available for the project.

We have created two smart-contracts one upload files to IPFS and using the hash gotten from the service use it to store it on the blockchain, while the other would be to use retrieve the saved data from the blockchain.

The project was finally deployed and the link to the live prototype is [Here](https://#)
